# Instaclone
An Instagram clone made with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [Tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

## Why
A few months ago the team behind Next.js announced the Layouts RFC and with that they opened a Pandora box in terms of possibilities.

One of the features proposed was intercepting router and as soon as I read its description I immediately thought of Instagram and how they do the same exact thing on their feed web page.

This got me thinking about a potential demo app that emulates Instagram's behaviour using Next.js' route intercepting capabilities.

## Timeline
The repo is empty since these exciting new features are not yet available to the public and are just being discussed for a future implementation.

As of September 2022 development has started and the dev team behind Next.js may announce the public beta in the upcoming months.
